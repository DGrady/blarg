			<h1>Beer batch 8</h1>
		</header>
		<p>Oatmeal stout, my first attempt at something that's not a Belgian IPA.</p>
<ul>
<li>6# Breiss dried light malt extract</li>
<li>2 oz Liberty hop pellets (3.9% AA)</li>
<li>WLP004 Irish Ale yeast</li>
<li>?# roasted barley</li>
<li>?# British crystal malt</li>
<li>?# flaked oats</li>
</ul>

<p>~3 gallons of water to the boil</p>
<p>By 1115 it was boiling, left it on until about 1130</p>
<p>So 1 hour to sterilize 3 gallons.</p>
<p>But it took until 2200 or so before it was close to room temperature.</p>

<p><img src="2014-02-09.jpg" class="aside" alt="Batch 8 just after siphoning into carboys"></p>
<p>Used the coffee grinder at very coarse setting to grind the barley and crystal malt; added those plus oats to the must bag. Into the pot with about 2 gallons of water; raised temp to around 170°F and held it there for 30 minutes. Removed the must bag; increased heat to boiling; added the malt extract and 1.5 oz hops and boiled for about 50 minutes. Towards the end of the boil, the must bag had cooled enough that I could squeeze more water out of it; collected this in a bowl and dumped back into the wort.</p>
<p>Cut heat; added last 0.5 oz of hops and let it steep for 15 minutes; then added cool water, which brought temp down but it was still above 80°F. Let it sit for the rest of the afternoon, outside part of the time.</p>
<p>Around 1800 it was nearly room temp, but still not down to the range of the Fermometer. Oh well! Added 2 tsp yeast energizer and the yeast, gave it a good stir, and siphoned into 2 x 2.5 gallon carboys.</p>
<p><em>After</em> I remembered to take a gravity reading, which stood at 7.5% potential alcohol.</p>

<p><img src="2014-02-10.jpg" class="aside" alt="One day in"></p>
<p>In the morning, nothing. But in the evening, both carboys are happily bubbling away.</p>
<h2 id="february-2014-2">14 February 2014</h2>
<p>Re-racked the small carboys into the single 5-gallon carboy in the evening. Both small carboys were mostly quiescent by this point. Added 2 tsp yeast energizer to the large carboy.</p>

<p>Bottling!</p>
<p>1/2 c priming sugar</p>
<h2 id="goals-for-next-time">Goals for next time</h2>
<ul>
<li>Seems like leaving the water to cool for more than overnight in the fridge might be better</li>
<li>Remember to sanitize the outside of the yeast container</li>
</ul>
