			<h1>The Brew Plan</h1>
		</header>
		<h1 id="equipment">Equipment</h1>
<ul>
<li>Bottle brushes</li>
<li>5-gallon fermenter</li>
<li>5-gallon brew pot</li>
<li>Immersion cooler</li>
<li>Thermometer</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="consumable-supplies">Consumable supplies</h1>
<ul>
<li>Bottles (expect to use 2 cases (48) of 12-ounce bottles)</li>
<li>Bottle caps</li>
<li>A bunch of ice
<ul>
<li>The plan is to create an ice water reservoir</li>
</ul></li>
<li>6 gallons of bottled water
<ul>
<li>Tap water has stuff in it to keep it sanitary. Common wisdom holds that this stuff is chlorine; you can get rid of chlorine in tap water by boiling it for a bit. <a href="tap-water-chlorine">Some random yahoo on the Internet</a> claims that most water utilities in the United States are switching to chloramines instead of chlorine or ozone to keep municipal water sanitary. Apparently boiling doesn't get rid of chloramines.</li>
<li>Our tap water is also pretty hard, which apparently lots of people can taste, but I can't.</li>
<li>Bottled water is sanitary.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>General cleaner for brewing equipment
<ul>
<li>Cleaner is for getting crud off your stuff.</li>
<li>Dish soap and dishwasher detergent will get your stuff clean, but
<ul>
<li>they often contain perfumes that can be absorbed into plastic, which can show up in your beer later</li>
<li>they can sometimes leave films on glassware or other brewing equipment that, if not rinsed thoroughly with hot water a few times, can leave off flavors in your beer or screw up the head retention of you beer (if you wash bottles in a dishwasher, for example)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="citation" data-cites="Palmer:2006wq">@Palmer:2006wq</span> recommends percarbonates like <a href="pbw">Powder Brewery Wash</a> or <a href="sa">Straight-A</a> because they clean as effectively as bleach, rinse easily, are unscented, and are safe to use on all the plastics and metals used in home brewing</li>
<li>You'll need roughly 1 tablespoon per gallon of water (1 fluid ounce is 2 tablespoons)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Acidic cleaner for dealing with scale, beerstone, and others (<a href="clr">Calcium, Lime, and Rust Remover</a> from Jelmar works well for this)</li>
<li>Sanitizer
<ul>
<li>Sanitizer is for killing a lot of the microorganisms that live on your stuff.</li>
<li><span class="citation" data-cites="Palmer:2006wq">@Palmer:2006wq</span> recommends <a href="ss">StarSan</a> or <a href="fs">Final Step</a> (which are phosphoric or anionic surfactants) over bleach or idophors because
<ul>
<li>they require only 30 seconds of contact time,</li>
<li>they do not require rinsing,</li>
<li>they won't contribute off flavors if you use too much of them, and</li>
<li>you can put them in a spray bottle for a quick sanitization (the spray is just as effective as immersion in solution).am</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You'll need about 1 fluid ounce per five gallons</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h1>
<p>You need at least:</p>
<ul>
<li>Malt extract</li>
<li>Yeast</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="procedure">Procedure</h1>
<ul>
<li>Fill the 5-gallon fermenter with tap water and the appropriate amount of sanitizer; put everything in the sanitizer.</li>
<li>Transfer the sanitary water to another bucket (will use it as cold water reservoir for cooling wort)</li>
<li>Clean the bottles. Use a bottle brush to scrub them, making sure the inside surfaces are clean and free of any crud.</li>
<li>Sterilize the bottles. Once they are clean and dry, an easy way to sterilize them is to hold them at 350℉ for one hour. Most beer bottles are made of soda lime glass (as opposed to the borosilicate glass that Pyrex and other cookware is made from); this makes them more susceptible to thermal shock and breakage. Heat them slowly by putting them into the oven before you turn it on. You can wrap each bottle opening with aluminum foil before sterilizing them; they will remain sterile as long as you don't remove the foil.</li>
</ul>
