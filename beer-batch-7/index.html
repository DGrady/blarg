			<h1>Beer batch 7</h1>
		</header>
		<p>Another in my line of Belgians. Next up, though: oatmeal stout.</p>
<ul>
<li>6# Breiss dried light malt extract</li>
<li>White Labs WLP550 Trappist Ale yeast</li>
<li>2 oz. Willamette hop pellets (4.9% AA) (whoops - meant to use this for the stout)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="november-2013">23 November 2013</h2>
<p>Boiled 3 gallons water in the evening; let it cool overnight with the pot lid on.</p>
<p>Yeast starter with about 2 cups water (final measure) and ¼ cup malt extract; into sanitized Mason jar to cool; pitched yeast when it was at room temperature.</p>
<h2 id="november-2013-1">24 November 2013</h2>
<p>Moved boiled water to the fridge in a fermentation bucket around 9 AM.</p>
<p>Brought about 2½ gallons water to boil, added malt and about ⅔ of the hops; continued boil for 30-40 minutes. Cut heat; added the rest of the hops; covered pot. Cooled until about 8 PM.</p>
<p>Added cool water from fridge, bringing wort to about 70-72°F. Pitched the yeast starter (no observable activity). Original gravity at 1.05 (6¾% potential alcohol). Siphoned into 2 x 3 gallon carboys and capped.</p>
<h2 id="november-2013-2">25 November 2013</h2>
<p>Vigorous fermentation observed this evening.</p>
<h2 id="december-2013">2 December 2013</h2>
<p>Re-racked into the 5-gallon carboy and added 2½ tsp of yeast energizer.</p>
<h2 id="december-2013-1">3 December 2013</h2>
<p>Mild activity - bubble every 30 seconds maybe.</p>
<h2 id="december-2013-2">8 December 2013</h2>
<p>Bottling. All bottles had gone through the dishwasher; also sterilized (some of them) in the oven at 350°F for 1 hour. Racked the carboy off into the boiling pot, making sure to add lots of oxygen and for stirring.</p>
<p>Recovered a total of 33 × 12 oz + 7 × 16 oz + 1 × 24 oz = 532 oz = 4.16 gallons.</p>
<p>Un-carbonated sample glass is quite good - not too sweet.</p>
<p>Final gravity reading at 1% potential alcohol, so the actual ABV should be around 6%.</p>
<h2 id="december-2013-3">15 December 2013</h2>
<p>Opened a swing-top and regular bottle; both are still basically flat.</p>
<h2 id="goals-for-next-time">Goals for next time</h2>
<ul>
<li>Remember to use priming sugar by getting more sleep</li>
<li>Recover a higher volume - losing most of a gallon seems like a lot. Could try using a cheesecloth filter when re-racking the first time; maybe use Aeropress and filter for the bottling.</li>
</ul>
