			<h1>Beer batch 13</h1>
		</header>
		<p>This batch is based purely on a brew kit someone gifted me.</p>
<h1 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
<li>Cooper's English Bitter liquid malt extract thing (includes hops)</li>
<li>1# dry light malt extract also from Cooper's</li>
<li>Cooper's packet of dry yeast</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="brew-day-26-october-2015">Brew day — 26 October 2015</h1>
<p>I wasn't great about keeping time on this one, so all times approximate.</p>
<dl>
<dt>11:00</dt>
<dd>Put 2 gallons of bottled water on to boil. Once boiling, cut the heat and added all the LME and DME while mixing. Attached thermometer and brought it back to a simmer. Noted that the 100℃ point on my thermometer agreed with the boiling point for the wort. Left it simmering for 45 minutes. Made up 5 gallons iodophor solution in the fermentation bucket to sanitize the immersion cooler.
</dd>
<dt>12:30</dt>
<dd>After the boil, cut the heat and first used the immersion cooler to cycle through the iodophor solution, which cut the temperature down to about 60℃. Then made up about 1 gallon of ice water in another bucket and cycled that through, which brought it down to just under 40℃. Added 1 gallon of bottled water that had been sitting in the fridge for about an hour, which brought it down to 30℃. Transferred wort to the fermentation bucket, added yeast, and topped with bottled water from the fridge. Took a reading at 2.5% potential alcohol by volume. Capped and shook up the bucket to get some more aeration.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Post-mortem:</p>
<ul>
<li>I was a little sloppy with sanitation this time.</li>
<li>The thermometer appears to be correctly calibrated.</li>
<li>The staged water bath seems to work well enough, although it did still take about an hour to get it down to the right temperature for pitching the yeast.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="october-2015">28 October 2015</h1>
<p>The fermentation hadn't started, so today I re-pitched with one of the new White Labs strains that comes in a soft pack (British Ale?). Fermentation was proceeding nicely by the morning of 29 October. It's still going 1 November, but only one bubble every 20 seconds or so.</p>
<h1 id="november-2015">8 November 2015</h1>
<p>Bottling day. Scrubbed and sanitized 48 bottles. The Cooper’s kit came with little sugar pellets to use for priming, and I boiled 50 of those in a pot of water and added a spoonful of yeast energizer as it cooled. Major note for next time, I need to use the 5-gallon fermentation bucket for bottling; the kettle is absolutely not big enough and I could have gotten another ten bottles if I had planned more carefully. Gravity reading after adding the priming sugar was 1% potential alcohol by volume, so this is shaping up to be the weakest beer ever made. The taste was actually pretty good, very malty with a touch of burnt caramel, although it did seem kind of watery. The yeast seemed very active; the beer foamed slightly when I was stirring up the priming sugar and I could hear air escaping from the bottles after I had filled and set caps on them but before crimping.</p>
<h1 id="tasting">Tasting</h1>
<p>Excellent carbonation, terrible taste. It turned out thin and watery, and what flavor there is musty.</p>
<h1 id="for-next-time">For next time</h1>
<ul>
<li>Get a spray bottle for sanitizer.</li>
<li>Don’t use the boiling kettle for bottling; it’s not big enough.</li>
</ul>
