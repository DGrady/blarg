			<h1>Beer batch 13</h1>
		</header>
		<p>This batch is based purely on a brew kit someone gifted me.</p>
<h1 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
<li>Cooper's English Bitter liquid malt extract thing (includes hops)</li>
<li>1# dry light malt extract also from Cooper's</li>
<li>Cooper's packet of dry yeast</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="brew-day-26-october-2015">Brew day — 26 October 2015</h1>
<p>I wasn't great about keeping time on this one, so all times approximate.</p>
<dl>
<dt>11:00</dt>
<dd>Put 2 gallons of bottled water on to boil. Once boiling, cut the heat and added all the LME and DME while mixing. Attached thermometer and brought it back to a simmer. Noted that the 100℃ point on my thermometer agreed with the boiling point for the wort. Left it simmering for 45 minutes. Made up 5 gallons idophor solution in the fermentation bucket to sanitize the immersion cooler.
</dd>
<dt>12:30</dt>
<dd>After the boil, cut the heat and first used the immersion cooler to cycle through the idophor solution, which cut the temperature down to about 60℃. Then made up about 1 gallon of ice water in another bucket and cycled that through, which brought it down to just under 40℃. Added 1 gallon of bottled water that had been sitting in the fridge for about an hour, which brought it down to 30℃. Transferred wort to the fermentation bucket, added yeast, and topped with bottled water from the fridge. Took a reading at 2.5% potential alcohol by volume. Capped and shook up the bucket to get some more aeration.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Post-mortem:</p>
<ul>
<li>I was a little sloppy with sanitation this time.</li>
<li>The thermometer appears to be correctly calibrated.</li>
<li>The staged water bath seems to work well enough, although it did still take about an hour to get it down to the right temperature for pitching the yeast.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="for-next-time">For next time</h1>
<ul>
<li>Get a spray bottle for sanitizer</li>
</ul>
